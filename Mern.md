MONGODB DATABASE

We need a database where we will store our data. For this we will make use of mLab. mLab provides MongoDB database as a service solution (DBaaS), so to make life easy, you will need to sign up for a shared clusters free account, which is ideal for our use case. Sign up here. Follow the sign up process, select AWS as the cloud provider, and choose a region near you.
